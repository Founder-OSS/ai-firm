# The Way to Rust

This repo is my personal journey into building a serious AI stack on tiny hardware and zero budget.

- Rust + Axum backend for speed and safety.
- Qdrant and RAG for “AI firm” style specialist agents.
- Next.js frontend that will grow into a multi-professional workspace.

Built by a broke college student on a 4 GB Chromebook, one command at a time.
